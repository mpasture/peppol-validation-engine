PEPPOL BIS v2 validation engine.

#Usage notes
Please ensure that your stack size is at least 1MB. Using the Oracle runtime, this can be achieved by passing `-Xss1m` on the commandline. This only seems to be a problem when running 32bit Java. With 64bit Java, the default stack size of the Oracle JVM is already 1MB.
